# Sudoku
Messing around with Ruby.  These are sudoku solvers that run on a command line interface, working on an input string of space-separated numbers and .'s representing the puzzle, e.g ./sudoku.rb puzzle.  I might make a proper interface one day if I feel like it.

sudoku.rb: 3x3 sudoku solver. Supports puzzles with character ranges [1-9], [a-i], and [A-I].

sudoku_remix.rb: 4x4 sudoku solver.  Still very flawed because I'm a stupid idiot.
